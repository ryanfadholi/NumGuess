NumGuess
========

Hello, and welcome to my first repository!

This repository contains NumGuess code.
The aim for players in this game is to guess an unknown, random number as fast as possible to gain as many score as possible.

NumGuess was created as a part of  my CS study, and NumGuess was never nor will be developed as a product. Because of that, I am NOT responsible for any damage, loss, or loss of profit from the code.

You may use the provided code as you wish, including but not limited to commercial and non-commercial purposes.
